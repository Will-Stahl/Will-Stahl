## About Me
I am studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota (2023). I enjoy seeing projects come together.
When I'm not coding and schooling, I like 3D printing and running. Combine these two and I have found myself using
3D printing to build track spikes (racing track shoes).

## Coding Experience
<*language*>(*experience*)
- C (Computer Architecture and Design, Introduction to Operating Systems)
- C++ (Program Design and Development)
- Python (Introduction to Programming, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)
- Java (Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures)
- OCaml (Advanced Programming Principles)

## Currently Learning
HTML/CSS/JavaScript on the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) as of 6/1/22.

## Current Work
I'm currently looking for an internship, research, or related job for the summer. Otherwise, I would like to begin an entry-level project.
It may not be entry-level, but I would like to write a Cura or 3D printing slicer extension that adds custom infill pattern
(BCC lattice with x, y, z axes removed and other adjustable parameters).
